# PySchaeffer

## Introduction

PySchaeffer provides a set of Python 3 functions for sound generation.

In order to **Keep It** as **Simple** and **Stupid** as possible :

* No library is needed.
* No real time.
* Sampling is fixed to 44100Hz.
* All durations are in ms.
* Sound data are Python 3 `list`s.

## Conventions

Sounds are Python 3 `list`s of `float` numbers (between `-1.0` and `1.0`)
